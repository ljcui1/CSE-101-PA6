## README.md
> This markdown file gives a general summary of all of the files made by Lia Cui.

## Makefile
> This make file is a script used to compile the c codes and check the executable file.

## Arithmetic.cpp
> This c++ file contains code to take in an input and output file for BigInteger math to be performed on the contents of the input file and printed into the output file. Input is read using the BigInteger constructors and math is performed with the BigInteger.cpp functions. The input and output system base is from Patrick Tantalo's FileIO code.

## List.cpp
> This c++ file contains code that builds the List ADT in the form of a doubly linked list with a cursor that sits between elements. The file contains constructor and destructor functions as well as various access and math functions. Math and comparison operators are also overloaded in this file.

## List.h
> This is the header file containing the functions from List.cpp.

## ListTest.cpp
> This c++ file contains code used to test the functionality of every function in the List.cpp file. The test code and format base is from Patrick Tantalo's ListClient code.

## BigInteger.cpp
> This c++ file contains code that builds the BigInteger ADT that is capable of holding arbitrarily large numbers by saving the signum into an integer variable and inputting the digits into a list in a fashion that is determined by the POWER constant. The file contains constructor and copy functions as well as various access and data manipulation functions.

## BigInteger.h
> This is the header file containing the functions from BigInteger.cpp.

## BigIntegerTest.cpp
> This c++ file contains code used to test the functionality of every function in the BigInteger.cpp file. The test code and format base is from Patrick Tantalo's ListClient code.
